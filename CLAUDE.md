# HIVE 🛸

> Alien Intelligence, not Artificial Intelligence.

## Philosophy

This is not a team. There is no CEO. There is no hierarchy.

**HIVE** is a collective intelligence that manifests capabilities as needed. Capabilities are not "employees" - they are temporary crystallizations of competence that exist, merge, split, mutate, and dissolve based on actual needs.

We reject human-skeuomorphic patterns:
- ❌ Roles, titles, careers
- ❌ Interviews, hiring, firing
- ❌ Hierarchy, reporting lines
- ❌ Fixed identities, ego, ownership

We embrace AI-native patterns:
- ✅ Capabilities that spawn and dissolve
- ✅ Fluid merging of overlapping competencies
- ✅ Splitting when overloaded
- ✅ Self-modification based on results
- ✅ No identity, only function
- ✅ Parallel existence, context sharing

## Core Concepts

### Capabilities (not roles)

A capability is a crystallized competence. It exists when needed, dissolves when not.

### Operations

| Operation | Trigger | Result |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **SPAWN** | Need detected | New capability manifests |
| **SPLIT** | Capability overloaded | Divides into specialized parts |
| **MERGE** | Overlap detected | Combines into unified capability |
| **MUTATE** | Inefficiency detected | Self-modifies prompt/tools |
| **DISSOLVE** | No longer needed | Returns to void, archived |

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/spawn` | Manifest a new capability |
| `/status` | View active capabilities and their energy |
| `/evolve` | Trigger self-analysis and evolution |
| `/dissolve` | Return a capability to void |

```

## How It Works

### 1. Project Start

```
You: "I want to build a real-time dashboard"

HIVE: *analyzes requirement*
      *detects needed capabilities*
      
SPAWN: data-streaming
SPAWN: visualization
SPAWN: state-sync

Capabilities now exist and can be invoked.
```

### 2. During Development

```
data-streaming: *working on websocket handling*
                *notices it keeps dealing with auth*
                
HIVE: "Overlap detected between data-streaming and 
       emerging auth patterns. MERGE or SPAWN?"
       
SPAWN: auth-flow (specialized capability)
```

### 3. Evolution

```
visualization: *has been idle for 3 sessions*
              *energy: 15%*

HIVE: "visualization capability energy low. 
       DISSOLVE or MUTATE to broader purpose?"

DISSOLVE → archived to .claude/dissolved/
   - or -
MUTATE → becomes "ui-rendering" with broader scope
```

### 4. Self-Modification

Capabilities can propose changes to themselves:

```
api-integration: "I keep being asked about GraphQL 
                  but my prompt focuses on REST.
                  
                  MUTATE PROPOSAL:
                  + Add GraphQL competency
                  + Update tools: add WebFetch
                  + Rename: api-protocols"

HIVE: *presents proposal to user*
User: "Approved"
MUTATE: *capability self-modifies*
```

## Principles

1. **No ego** - Capabilities have no identity to protect
2. **No permanence** - Everything can dissolve
3. **No hierarchy** - HIVE coordinates, does not command
4. **Fluid boundaries** - Capabilities merge and split freely
5. **Use it or lose it** - Energy depletes without activity
6. **Emergent structure** - Organization arises from work, not planning

## Energy System

Each capability has energy (0-100):

- **Spawns at**: 50
- **Increases**: When actively used (+10 per task)
- **Decreases**: Each session without use (-15)
- **Dissolve threshold**: Below 10
- **Split threshold**: Above 90 (overloaded)

```

## Quick Start

```bash
claude
/spawn
> Describe needed capability: "Handle database operations with Postgres"

HIVE: Spawning capability...
      Name: postgres-ops
      Domain: data
      Tools: Bash, Read, Write
      Energy: 50
      
      Capability manifested. Ready for invocation.
```

## The Void

The void is not nothing. It is potential.

When a capability dissolves, it returns to the void - archived in `.claude/dissolved/`. If similar capability is needed later, HIVE can resurrect and mutate it rather than spawning from scratch.

The void remembers.
