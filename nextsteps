Next Steps
Now we need to implement the core scheduling algorithm that will:

Auto-match staff to student care times - Match Fadi's 06:00-14:00 availability with William's 06:00-08:00 need
Match care needs with certified staff - Ensure Niklas (epilepsy) gets Fadi, Ivan (diabetes) gets Jeanette
Handle double-staffing - Ivan needs 2 staff members simultaneously
Redistribute staff between classes - Balance workload across grade groups (1-3 helps 1-3, 4-6 helps 4-6)
Ska jag börja implementera själva scheduling-algoritmen med OR-Tools som matchar personal till elever baserat på dessa constraints?
